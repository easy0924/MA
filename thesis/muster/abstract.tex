We propose a novel data-driven rule-based preordering approach, which uses the information of syntax tree and word alignment to reorder the words in source sentences before decoding in a phrase-based \acs{SMT} system between English and Chinese. The preorering algorithm extracts reordering patterns from multiple levels of the syntax trees of the training data and applies the rules on the source sentences in a similar manner. \bigskip \\
We've conducted experiments in English-to-Chinese and Chinese-to-English translation directions. Our results show that the approach has led to improved translation quality both when it was applied separately on the baseline or when it was combined with some other reordering approaches. We report an improvement of $0.43$ in \acs{BLEU} score when our preordering approach was used in addition to the short rule \citep{short}, long rule\citep{long} and tree rule \citep{tree} based preordering approaches in the English-to-Chinese translation direction. There's also an improvement of $0.3$ in \acs{BLEU} score when our preordering approach was used in addition to the aforementioned preordering approaches in the Chinese-to-English translation direction. Through analyzing the translations, we've also found improvements in syntactic structure with our preordering approach.}
