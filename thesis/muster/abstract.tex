We propose a novel data-driven rule-based preordering approach, which uses the information of syntax tree and word alignment to reorder the words in source sentences before decoding in a phrase-based SMT system between English and Chinese. Our results show that the approach has led to improved translation quality both when it was applied separately on the baseline or when it was combined with some other reordering approaches. We've conducted experiments on English-to-Chinese and Chinese-to-English translation directions. We report improvements of up to $2.16$ when the approach was used separately and improvements of up to $0.43$ when it was added to the other reordering approaches. Examples of the translations also showed our approach has helped to improve the sentence structure obviously.
