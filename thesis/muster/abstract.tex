We propose a novel data-driven rule-based pre-reordering approach, which use the information of syntax tree and word alignment to rearrange the words in source sentence before decoding in a phrase-based statistical machine translation system between English and Chinese. Our results shows that the approach leads to improved translation quality both when it is applied separately on the baseline or when it is combined with some other reordering approaches. We present experiemnts on English-to-Chinese and Chinese-to-English translation directions. We report improvements of up to $2.16$ when it is used separately and improvements of up to $0.43$ when it is added to the other reordering approaches. Examples of the translations also shows our approach also helps to improve the sentence structure obviously.
